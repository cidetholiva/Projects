Cideth Oliva Final Project: Matlib
=====================================================

Thought process/ Instructions: 
------------------------------

For this game, I proposed making a Mad Libs Generator that gathers user input data like adjectives, adverbs,
pronouns, and verbs to build a story. For each "slot" in the story, instead of just asking for one word 
(adjective, noun, etc.), the game requires the user to enter THREE words of that type, and then the program randomly
picks one for the end result. 


How to play step by step:
==========================
1. Begin by running import random, until it promps for an adjective. 
2. Input adjectives, nouns, verbs and adverbs as prompted.
3. Then, run the line that starts with madlib = f""" and print(madlib.strip()). 
4. Read your madlib and enjoy!
